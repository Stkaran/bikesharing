# bikesharing

## Purpose
For this analysis, we are trying to help a friend to determine if they would be able to get a bike sharing system in place in Des Moines. In order to see if this is a possibilty, we looked at a bike sharing model in New York to see if it could be used in Iowa.

## Results

To begin, we look to see what the averge duration of checkout time for the bikes. We can see here that the majority of checkout times are for a very short duration(about 10mins).

The next graph is of the same topic, but with the population spilt up by gender. It is quite clear that the number of users is heavily skewed toward males users. However, across all genders, the low trip duration trend is still reflected.

Here we can see two major trends. One, most of the rides are occuring on the Weekdays (Monday->Friday). The other trend is the time of those days. 8am and 5-6pm are the most popular times. With this chart specifically, we can start to hypothesize that these points in the week are more popular due to people using the bikes as their choice of transportation to get to work.

Just like last time, this chart breaks things down by gender, and while there are less users overall, the times of popularity still stay the same across gender.

Now we can break down the population between one time customers and repeat users(subscribers). We can see that subscriber numbers easily dwarf other customers when it comes to usage of the bikes. This point gives further evidence that people are mainly using the system as a way to commute to work.

These last two visualizations put the nail in the coffin for our theory. Here we looked at the top starting and ending locations for the bike usage. Most of the trips are being taking in dense urban areas, where as usage starts to drop off as you move further away into more rural areas where bikes may no longer be practical.

## Results
In conclusion, if a bike sharing service is going to be successful in Des Moines, there are quite a few requirements the city needs to meet. The first and most important, is the city designed for bike usage? When it comes to urban planning, many cities heavily lean towards ease of movement for cars, not bikes so the city needs to make bikes feel both safe and as a viable method of transportation. On top of this, work hubs a need to be prioritized if people are going to use them to get to work like in New York. 

Another major point that needs to be addressed is the gap in usage due to gender. If you aren't able to convince more women that using these bikes can be a safe experience, it's hard to see that gender gap closing and that will hurt the long time viability of the program.
Lastly, it will be important find ways to increase use on the weekends. This will take investment by the city to create activites that can be enjoyed during these aleternate times.

As for how else we could use this data, it could help to look customer vs. subscriber based on age. This would give the city an idea of which demographics they'll need to put extra resources into to get the whole population on board. It may also help to look at the less popular start and ending locations as these routes could them be examined to see if there are any barriers to using bikes in these areas. If so, hopefully the city could provide a solution for the areas through construction or other means.
